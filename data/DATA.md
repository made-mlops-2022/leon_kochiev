# About Dataset

### Context
The data is already presented in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci but there are some descriptions and values that are wrong as discussed in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877. So, here is re-processed dataset that was cross-checked with the original data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease.

4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    * Value 0: normal
    * Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    * Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
